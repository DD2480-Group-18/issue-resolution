## Project

Name: Next.js

URL: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications. Next.js has a collection of amazing tools but is mostly known as a framework for creating SSG (Server Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generated) web applications.

## Onboarding experience

We chose Next.js as our new project. The onboarding experience is vastly different. While they have an [Onboarding video for new developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuoNzXFLitc), they lack the [highly detailed documentation of internals](https://threejs.org/docs/) provided by Three.js.
